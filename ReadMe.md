## jOS
The jOS project is an operating system I am currently learning to build using C and Assembly. 
So far, I have built the boot-loader, successfully loaded the OS into 32bit protected mode 
and displayed text onto the screen.

The purpose of this project is to learn more advanced programming concepts; by the end of
this project, I will have successfully built a usable kernel. This operating system will
mostly render similiarly to operating systems from the 80s-90s.

I will also expand on this operating system to see if networking capabilities can be
added.
